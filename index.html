<h1>The Sport of Lacrosse</h1>
<h2>A website all about lacrosse</h2>

<p> 
Lacrosse is a team sport played with a lacrosse stick and a lacrosse ball. Players use the head of the lacrosse stick to carry, pass, catch, and shoot the ball into the goal. 
The sport is governed by the Federation of International Lacrosse; the most prominent international competition is the World Lacrosse Championship, which has been dominated by the United States.
The sport has four versions that have different sticks, fields, rules and equipment: field lacrosse, women's lacrosse, box lacrosse and intercrosse. The men's games, field lacrosse (outdoor) and box lacrosse (indoor), are contact sports and all players wear protective gear: helmet, gloves, shoulder pads, and elbow pads. The women's game does not allow body contact but does allow stick to stick contact. The only protective gear required for women players is eyegear, while goalies wear helmets and protective pads. Lacrosse is a mixed-gender non-contact sport that uses an all-plastic stick and a softer ball.</p>
